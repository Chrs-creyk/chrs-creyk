## **Welcome to my GitHub profile**

Hello! I am Cristhian, or Creyk, a programming student with a deep connection to nature and a commitment to sustainability. My goal is to use my programming and artistic skills to make a positive difference in the world and help protect the planet and life.
Currently, I am studying programming at [Hoberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)

I am passionate about technology and believe we can use it to create effective and efficient solutions to the environmental challenges we face.

When I'm not glued to a screen, I enjoy spending time outdoors and learning about new technologies, as I firmly believe technology can be used to improve our world and help protect our environment.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have excellent collaboration and communication skills, which allow me to work well in teams and contribute to projects with other developers from around the world.
